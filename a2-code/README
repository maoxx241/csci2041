Copy all files in this directory to the project directory a2-code. The
following unix command should do this a2-tests and a2-code are in the
same directory.

cp -r a2-tests/* a2-code/

The Makefile provided is a copy of Makefile.withtests. The original
version is called Makefile.notests.

The new Makefile introduces the targets
- make test-p1
- make test-p2
- make test-p3
- make test-p4
- make test    (does all of the above)

Test programs test_sortedlist1, test_sortedlist2, and test_undolist
associated with problems 1-3 can run individual tests by passing a
test number as a command line argument as in

./test_sortedlist2 3    # run the 3rd tests only

Test program test_listmanager.sh associated with problem 4 also has
this feature

./test_listmanager.sh 10  # run only the 10th test
